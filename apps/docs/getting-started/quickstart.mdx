# Prerequisites

- Works on latest **MacOS** and **Ubuntu Linux**.
- `node` & `npm` for the CLI.
- `uvx` for most of the servers. 
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed. (if you'd like director to configure them automatically).


# Quickstart

The fastest way to try director is to use run the quickstart flow via `npx`. This will run the latest version of director and open up the studio in your browser.

```bash
npx @director.run/cli@latest quickstart
```

# Alternative Methods

## Installing Locally

If you'd like to install director locally, you can do so via `npm`.

```bash
npm install -g @director.run/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director studio # open the studio in your browser
```

## Getting started with the CLI

If you'd like to set up director without going through the UI, you can do so via the CLI. If you'd like to see a more detailed example, you can check out the [CLI Reference](../sdk/cli).

```bash
npm install -g @director/cli
director serve # start the gateway
director create my-first-proxy # create a proxy
director add fetch --target=my-first-proxy # add the fetch server to the proxy
director connect my-first-proxy --target=claude # connect the proxy to Claude
director connect my-first-proxy --target=cursor # connect the proxy to Cursor
director connect my-first-proxy # print the manual connection details
```
