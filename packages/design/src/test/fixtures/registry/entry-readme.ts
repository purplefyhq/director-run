If your MCP host does not support remote MCP servers, don\'t worry! You can use the [local version of the GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#local-github-mcp-server) instead.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A compatible MCP host with remote server support (VS Code 1.101+, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)\n2. Any applicable [policies enabled](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/policies-and-governance.md)\n\n### Install in VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start. Make sure you\'re using [VS Code 1.101](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_101) or [later](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for remote MCP and OAuth support.\n\nAlternatively, to manually configure VS Code, choose the appropriate JSON block from the examples below and add it to your host configuration:\n\n<table>\n<tr><th>Using OAuth</th><th>Using a GitHub PAT</th></tr>\n<tr><th align=left colspan=2>VS Code (version 1.101 or greater)</th></tr>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td>\n  \n```json\n{\n  "servers": {\n    "github": {\n      "type": "http",\n      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  "servers": {\n    "github": {\n      "type": "http",\n      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",\n      "headers": {\n        "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:github_mcp_pat}"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  "inputs": [\n    {\n      "type": "promptString",\n      "id": "github_mcp_pat",\n      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",\n      "password": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Install in other MCP hosts\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Applications](/docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Web, Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI\n- **[Cursor](/docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE\n- **[Windsurf](/docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\n> **Note:** Each MCP host application needs to configure a GitHub App or OAuth App to support remote access via OAuth. Any host application that supports remote MCP servers should support the remote GitHub server with PAT authentication. Configuration details and support levels vary by host. Make sure to refer to the host application\'s documentation for more info.\n\n> ⚠️ **Public Preview Status:** The **remote** GitHub MCP Server is currently in Public Preview. During preview, access may be gated depending on authentication type and surface:\n> - OAuth: Subject to GitHub Copilot Editor Preview Policy until GA\n> - PAT: Controlled via your organization\'s PAT policies\n> - MCP Servers in Copilot policy: Enables/disables access to all MCP servers in VS Code, with other Copilot editors migrating to this policy in the coming months.\n\n### Configuration\nSee [Remote Server Documentation](/docs/remote-server.md) on how to pass additional configuration settings to the remote GitHub MCP Server.\n\n---\n\n## Local GitHub MCP Server\n\n[![Install with Docker in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D) [![Install with Docker in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=github&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22github_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22GitHub%20Personal%20Access%20Token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22docker%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22run%22%2C%22-i%22%2C%22--rm%22%2C%22-e%22%2C%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%2C%22ghcr.io%2Fgithub%2Fgithub-mcp-server%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Agithub_token%7D%22%7D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. To run the server in a container, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.\n2. Once Docker is installed, you will also need to ensure Docker is running. The image is public; if you get errors on pull, you may have an expired token and need to `docker logout ghcr.io`.\n3. Lastly you will need to [Create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).\nThe MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools (to learn more about access tokens, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).\n\n<details><summary><b>Handling PATs Securely</b></summary>\n\n### Environment Variables (Recommended)\nTo keep your GitHub PAT secure and reusable across different MCP hosts:\n\n1. **Store your PAT in environment variables**\n   ```bash\n   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file:\n   ```env\n   GITHUB_PAT=your_token_here\n   ```\n\n2. **Protect your `.env` file**\n   ```bash\n   # Add to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits\n   echo ".env" >> .gitignore\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference the token in configurations**\n   ```bash\n   # CLI usage\n   claude mcp update github -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PAT\n   \n   # In config files (where supported)\n   "env": {\n     "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_PAT"\n   }\n   ```\n\n> **Note**: Environment variable support varies by host app and IDE. Some applications (like Windsurf) require hardcoded tokens in config files.\n\n### Token Security Best Practices\n\n- **Minimum scopes**: Only grant necessary permissions\n  - `repo` - Repository operations\n  - `read:packages` - Docker image access\n- **Separate tokens**: Use different PATs for different projects/environments\n- **Regular rotation**: Update tokens periodically\n- **Never commit**: Keep tokens out of version control\n- **File permissions**: Restrict access to config files containing tokens\n  ```bash\n  chmod 600 ~/.your-app/config.json\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install in GitHub Copilot on VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons above. Once you complete that flow, toggle Agent mode (located by the Copilot Chat text input) and the server will start.\n\nMore about using MCP server tools in VS Code\'s [agent mode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).\n\nInstall in GitHub Copilot on other IDEs (JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.)\n\nAdd the following JSON block to your IDE\'s MCP settings.\n\n```json\n{\n  "mcp": {\n    "inputs": [\n      {\n        "type": "promptString",\n        "id": "github_token",\n        "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",\n        "password": true\n      }\n    ],\n    "servers": {\n      "github": {\n        "command": "docker",\n        "args": [\n          "run",\n          "-i",\n          "--rm",\n          "-e",\n          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",\n          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"\n        ],\n        "env": {\n          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with other host applications that accept the same format.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example JSON block without the MCP key included</b></summary>\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n  "inputs": [\n    {\n      "type": "promptString",\n      "id": "github_token",\n      "description": "GitHub Personal Access Token",\n      "password": true\n    }\n  ],\n  "servers": {\n    "github": {\n      "command": "docker",\n      "args": [\n        "run",\n        "-i",\n        "--rm",\n        "-e",\n        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",\n        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"\n      ],\n      "env": {\n        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Install in Other MCP Hosts\n\nFor other MCP host applications, please refer to our installation guides:\n\n- **[GitHub Copilot in other IDEs](/docs/installation-guides/install-other-copilot-ides.md)** - Installation for JetBrains, Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Xcode with GitHub Copilot\n- **[Claude Code & Claude Desktop](docs/installation-guides/install-claude.md)** - Installation guide for Claude Code and Claude Desktop\n- **[Cursor](docs/installation-guides/install-cursor.md)** - Installation guide for Cursor IDE  \n- **[Windsurf](docs/installation-guides/install-windsurf.md)** - Installation guide for Windsurf IDE\n\nFor a complete overview of all installation options, see our **[Installation Guides Index](docs/installation-guides/installation-guides.md)**.\n\n> **Note:** Any host application that supports local MCP servers should be able to access the local GitHub MCP server. However, the specific configuration process, syntax and stability of the integration will vary by host application. While many may follow a similar format to the examples above, this is not guaranteed. Please refer to your host application\'s documentation for the correct MCP configuration syntax and setup process.\n\n### Build from source\n\nIf you don\'t have Docker, you can use `go build` to build the binary in the\n`cmd/github-mcp-server` directory, and use the `github-mcp-server stdio` command with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable set to your token. To specify the output location of the build, use the `-o` flag. You should configure your server to use the built executable as its `command`. For example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  "mcp": {\n    "servers": {\n      "github": {\n        "command": "/path/to/github-mcp-server",\n        "args": ["stdio"],\n        "env": {\n          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Tool Configuration\n\nThe GitHub MCP Server supports enabling or disabling specific groups of functionalities via the `--toolsets` flag. This allows you to control which GitHub API capabilities are available to your AI tools. Enabling only the toolsets that you need can help the LLM with tool choice and reduce the context size.\n\n_Toolsets are not limited to Tools. Relevant MCP Resources and Prompts are also included where applicable._\n\n### Available Toolsets\n\nThe following sets of tools are available (all are on by default):\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n| Toolset                 | Description                                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `context`               | **Strongly recommended**: Tools that provide context about the current user and GitHub context you are operating in |\n| `actions` | GitHub Actions workflows and CI/CD operations |\n| `code_security` | Code security related tools, such as GitHub Code Scanning |\n| `dependabot` | Dependabot tools |\n| `discussions` | GitHub Discussions related tools |\n| `experiments` | Experimental features that are not considered stable yet |\n| `issues` | GitHub Issues related tools |\n| `notifications` | GitHub Notifications related tools |\n| `orgs` | GitHub Organization related tools |\n| `pull_requests` | GitHub Pull Request related tools |\n| `repos` | GitHub Repository related tools |\n| `secret_protection` | Secret protection related tools, such as GitHub Secret Scanning |\n| `users` | GitHub User related tools |\n<!-- END AUTOMATED TOOLSETS -->\n\n## Tools\n\n\n<!-- START AUTOMATED TOOLS -->\n<details>\n\n<summary>Actions</summary>\n\n- **cancel_workflow_run** - Cancel workflow run\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **delete_workflow_run_logs** - Delete workflow logs\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **download_workflow_run_artifact** - Download workflow artifact\n  - `artifact_id`: The unique identifier of the artifact (number, required)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n\n- **get_job_logs** - Get job logs\n  - `failed_only`: When true, gets logs for all failed jobs in run_id (boolean, optional)\n  - `job_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow job (required for single job logs) (number, optional)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `return_content`: Returns actual log content instead of URLs (boolean, optional)\n  - `run_id`: Workflow run ID (required when using failed_only) (number, optional)\n  - `tail_lines`: Number of lines to return from the end of the log (number, optional)\n\n- **get_workflow_run** - Get workflow run\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **get_workflow_run_logs** - Get workflow run logs\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **get_workflow_run_usage** - Get workflow usage\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_jobs** - List workflow jobs\n  - `filter`: Filters jobs by their completed_at timestamp (string, optional)\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `page`: Page number for pagination (min 1) (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page for pagination (min 1, max 100) (number, optional)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_run_artifacts** - List workflow artifacts\n  - `owner`: Repository owner (string, required)\n  - `page`: Page number for pagination (min 1) (number, optional)\n  - `perPage`: Results per page for pagination (min 1, max 100) (number, optional)\n  - `repo`: Repository name (string, required)\n  - `run_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow run (number, required)\n\n- **list_workflow_runs** - List workflow runs\n  - `actor`: Returns someone\'s workflow runs.

Please test it out and let us know if you encounter any issues.\n\nInstead of starting with all tools enabled, you can turn on dynamic toolset discovery. Dynamic toolsets allow the MCP host to list and enable toolsets in response to a user prompt. This should help to avoid situations where the model gets confused by the sheer number of tools available.\n\n### Using Dynamic Tool Discovery\n\nWhen using the binary, you can pass the `--dynamic-toolsets` flag.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --dynamic-toolsets\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the toolsets as environment variables:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_DYNAMIC_TOOLSETS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## Read-Only Mode\n\nTo run the server in read-only mode, you can use the `--read-only` flag. This will only offer read-only tools, preventing any modifications to repositories, issues, pull requests, etc.\n\n```bash\n./github-mcp-server --read-only\n```\n\nWhen using Docker, you can pass the read-only mode as an environment variable:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -i --rm \\\n  -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token> \\\n  -e GITHUB_READ_ONLY=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\n## GitHub Enterprise Server and Enterprise Cloud with data residency (ghe.com)\n\nThe flag `--gh-host` and the environment variable `GITHUB_HOST` can be used to set\nthe hostname for GitHub Enterprise Server or GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\n- For GitHub Enterprise Server, prefix the hostname with the `https://` URI scheme, as it otherwise defaults to `http://`, which GitHub Enterprise Server does not support.\n- For GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency, use `https://YOURSUBDOMAIN.ghe.com` as the hostname.\n``` json\n"github": {\n    "command": "docker",\n    "args": [\n    "run",\n    "-i",\n    "--rm",\n    "-e",\n    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",\n    "-e",\n    "GITHUB_HOST",\n    "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"\n    ],\n    "env": {\n        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${input:github_token}",\n        "GITHUB_HOST": "https://<your GHES or ghe.com domain name>"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## i18n / Overriding Descriptions\n\nThe descriptions of the tools can be overridden by creating a\n`github-mcp-server-config.json` file in the same directory as the binary.\n\nThe file should contain a JSON object with the tool names as keys and the new\ndescriptions as values. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  "TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION": "an alternative description",\n  "TOOL_CREATE_BRANCH_DESCRIPTION": "Create a new branch in a GitHub repository"\n}\n```\n\nYou can create an export of the current translations by running the binary with\nthe `--export-translations` flag.\n\nThis flag will preserve any translations/overrides you have made, while adding\nany new translations that have been added to the binary since the last time you\nexported.\n\n```sh\n./github-mcp-server --export-translations\ncat github-mcp-server-config.json\n```\n\nYou can also use ENV vars to override the descriptions. The environment\nvariable names are the same as the keys in the JSON file, prefixed with\n`GITHUB_MCP_` and all uppercase.\n\nFor example, to override the `TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION` tool, you can\nset the following environment variable:\n\n```sh\nexport GITHUB_MCP_TOOL_ADD_ISSUE_COMMENT_DESCRIPTION="an alternative description"\n```\n\n## Library Usage\n\nThe exported Go API of this module should currently be considered unstable, and subject to breaking changes. In the future, we may offer stability; please file an issue if there is a use case where this would be valuable.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.
