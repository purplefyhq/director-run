[Director](https://director.run) is a fully open source MCP middleware that unifies MCP server integration and deployment. It's MCP native and sits between your model and MCP servers. It implements a proxy pattern to aggragate all server functions behind a single MCP transport (Streamable, SSE or Stdio).

*Note: This is a new project under active development and is not yet stable.*

## Quickstart

You can use the command to try out director immediately. If you'd like to install it or learn more, please [read the docs](https://docs.director.run). 

```bash
$ npx @director.run/cli quickstart
```
